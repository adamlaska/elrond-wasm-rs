# releases-explained

This are the release descriptions that are going up on [the MultiversX releases page](https://multiversx.com/releases/wasm)

They are committed here for easier handling, rather them letting them be lost in private messages.


## Workflow

Developers should also add descriptions here after performing releases.

Then, whoever is responsible with the public releases web page should add them there as well.

Unfortunately, developers do not have direct access there, nor is it currently possible to automate the upload.
